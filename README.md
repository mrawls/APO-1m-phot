# APO-1m-phot
Tools for dealing with observations using the Apache Point Observatory 1m robotically controlled telescope. Most of these tools are specifically for multiband photometry of eclipsing binaries.

eclipsefinder.py - Takes a text infile and makes (1) a plot of when EB eclipses will be, (2) a text file listing these eclipses, and (3) a text file formatted for use by the robotically controlled 1m telescope at APO.

More coming "soon."
